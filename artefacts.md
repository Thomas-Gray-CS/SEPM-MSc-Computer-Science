Object Oriented Programming - Artefacts 

On this page are a number of artefacts that I have gather from my studies of Object Oriented Programming as part of my MSc Computer Science course. These show my development relating to coding practice, UML and computing theory that aligns with OOP.

### Unit 4: Estimating Tools and Risk Assessment

The below document discusses the idea of project risks and what can be done to mitigate these.

[Software Development Risks](/pdf/software_development_risks.pdf)


### Artefact 2: Collaborative Discussion regarding Reusability of Code in OOP

The below artefact shows how I meet Learning Outcome 1) Appraise and critically evaluate object-oriented programming compared to other programming paradigms.

[Collaborative Discussion](/pdf/collaborative_discussion.pdf)


### Artefact 3: UML Models within the Software Development Life Cycle

The below artefact shows how I meet Learning Outcome 4) Propose object-oriented solutions using an appropriate modelling language, such as UML.

[UML and SDLC](/pdf/uml_in_sdlc.pdf)


### Artefact 4: Python Code Showing Protected and Unprotected Variables

The below artefact shows how I meet Learning Outcome 2) Design and implement programs that demonstrate appropriate use of object-oriented design principles.

```
        class Student:
          def __init__(self, name, age, ID):
            self.name = name # this is an unprotected variable
            self.age = age # this is unprotected
            self._ID = ID # the “_” prior to “ID” highlights this as a protected variable
        
        s1 = Student("Billy", 15, 1443)
        
        print(s1.name)
        print(s1.age)
        print(s1._ID)
```

### Artefact 5: Polymorphism Example

The below artefact also shows how I meet Learning Outcome 2) Design and implement programs that demonstrate appropriate use of object-oriented design principles.

```
    class SteerLeft:
        def __init__(self, direction, degrees):
            self.direction = direction 
            self.degrees = degrees
    
        def info(self):
            print(f"Turning {self.direction} for {self.degrees}.")
    
    
    
    class SteerRight:
        def __init__(self, direction, degrees):
            self.direction = direction # this has been reused from the SteerLeft class as a form of polymorphism
            self.degrees = degrees
    
        def info(self):
            print(f"Turning {self.direction} for {self.degrees}.")
        
    
    Left1 = SteerLeft("Left", 90)
    Right1 = SteerRight("Right", 90)
    
    for directional in (Left1, Right1):
        directional.info()
```

### Artefact 6: Discussion On Cyclomatic Complexity

The below artefact shows how I meet Learning Outcome 1) Appraise and critically evaluate object-oriented programming compared to other programming paradigms.
