## Learning Outcomes

The learning outcomes for this module are as follows:

1) Appraise and critically evaluate object-oriented programming compared to other programming paradigms.
2) Design and implement programs that demonstrate appropriate use of object-oriented design principles.
3) Select and use appropriate data structures for a given problem.
4) Propose object-oriented solutions using an appropriate modelling language, such as UML.

Reference to these is made throughout my portfolio to highlight how I have met them.
