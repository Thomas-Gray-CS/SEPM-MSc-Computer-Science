## Learning Outcomes

The learning outcomes for this module are as follows:

1) Identify and apply appropriate software engineering and project management methodologies, tools and techniques for the development of solutions to real-world problems.
2) Explore the implications of computer and network architectures for system-level design and development, as appropriate for risk and quality management.
3) Design, develop and evaluate management systems to produce solutions that handle constraints and uncertainty, contextualising BDD concepts and secure coding principles & practices in SDLC.
4) Systematically develop and implement the skills required to be effective member of a development team in a virtual professional environment, adopting real-life perspectives on roles and team organisation.

Reference to these is made throughout my portfolio to highlight how I have met them.
